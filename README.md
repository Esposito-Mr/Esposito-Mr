# 🧠 João – Researcher, Creator, Storyteller  

## Welcome to My World  

I’m João, a passionate **biomedical and biotechnology researcher**, a dedicated **Game Master and storyteller**, and a relentless **creator**—whether it’s in the lab, on the game table, or through 3D printing. My journey is a fusion of science, creativity, and deep curiosity about the unknown.  

### 🔬 **Scientist at Heart**  
I have a background in **Biomedical Sciences** and am currently pursuing a second bachelor's in **Biotechnology**. My research interests span **bionics, neurobiology, immunology, and genetics**, with a strong focus on **reproducing neural networks and understanding the brain in a laboratory setting**. The dream? To push the boundaries of what we know about **human cognition and health**.   

### 🏋️ **Strength in Mind & Body**  
I recently returned to the **gym with a push-pull-legs routine**, balancing **intensity with adaptation**. Just like in research and game design, progress is about **consistency and refinement**.  

### 📺 **Sharing the Journey**  
I plan to create a **YouTube channel** focused on **tips for Game Masters and players**, sharing insights into world-building, mechanics, and narrative depth. If you love RPGs, stay tuned!  

## 🌌 Let’s Connect  
If you’re passionate about **science, RPGs, 3D printing, or storytelling**, I’d love to exchange ideas! Whether you're here for research collaborations, game design discussions, or just some **epic nerd talk**, welcome aboard.  

🚀 **Step into a world where science, creation, and imagination collide.**
